It started as a normal day for Chris Gonzalez. He woke up and ate eggo waffles for breakfast. He listened to Lil Uzi Vert as he drove to school. First period was normal. Second period was normal. Then in the middle of third period, he went to go take a piss. That's when things stopped being normal. As he walked in the bathroom, Chris immediately noticed how the middle urinal had been replaced my a gaping hole,big enough for a person to go through. A very bored Chris looked into the hole, and quickly realized it was a tunnel, with no end in sight. Chris crawled through the tunnel then what he saw shocked him...
In the middle of this tunnel that was once a urinal, was a shrine that could only be created by a 17 year old boy. The shrine was in honor of the great and reverent Channing Tatum. Chaning Tatum circa Battle in Seattle. It was beautiful and brought tears to Chris's eyes. Chris hasn't cried like that since the last time he visited the bathroom.
